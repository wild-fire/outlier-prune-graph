# Outlier pruning algorithm

The objective of this repositori is to implement a Hadoop algorithm for pruning outliers nodes from a graph.

And what's an outlier node? It's just a node with too many few edges that may became an edge case for some graph algorithms and must be clean before running your shiny algotihm over the graph.
